MADE FOR WINDOWS

This is a simple implementation of a dhcp server. Some machines (such as the
Procurve switches) come out of the box with the ability to telnet/ssh into it.

The scope of this project is small: implement the basic setting of a host IP
so that you can configure it without having to make a serial connection.
